## About Me  
I believe great products don’t just work — they resonate with people. That’s why I’m passionate about UX/UI design, cognitive science, and machine learning. I want to create tech that is not only efficient, but impactful and accessible.

Through my experience in ML research, a UX/UI internship, and the Break Through Tech AI program, I’ve explored both backend (data processing, ML modeling) and frontend (UX/UI design, user interviews). I’m looking for roles or projects that turn insights into people-first solutions.
